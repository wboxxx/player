# Player3 - Audio-Visual Practice Tool

This project is an interactive GUI-based audio/video loop player tailored for music practice and analysis.  
It was developed with the help of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) and includes original ideas and interface designs by Vincent Boiteau.

## Features

- Loop-based playback with A/B markers
- Tempo synchronization and grid display
- GUI with real-time feedback
- Optional integration of MIDI and audio analysis

## Getting Started

1. Run `./setup_env.sh` to create a virtual environment and install Python
   dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Activate the environment:
   `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Launch the application with `python player.py`.

The setup script reminds you to install system packages such as `ffmpeg` and
`python3-tk` which are required for full functionality.
